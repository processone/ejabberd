# tsung plotter configuration
#
# tsung provides three types of statistics:
#
# sample:  'name';'count(during the last 10sec)';mean;stdvar;max;min;globalmean;globalcount
# counter: 'name';'count in the last 10sec interval';globalcount(since the beginning)
# gauge:   'name';'current value'; max since the beginning
#

# matching between internal representation of tsung stats:
#  sample: sample, sample_counter
#  counter: sum, count
#  gauge: only 'users' data (special case)

# This file associates name stats with their type
