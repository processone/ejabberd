%% The 'any' and 'atom' argument types and 'any' result type
%% should only be used %% by commands with tag 'internal',
%% which are meant to be used only internally in ejabberd,
%% and not called using external frontends.

%% The purpose of a command can either be:
%% - informative: its purpose is to obtain information
%% - modifier: its purpose is to produce some change in the server
%%
%% A modifier command should be designed just to produce its desired side-effect,
%% and its result term should just be success or failure: rescode or restuple.
%%
%% ejabberd_web_admin:make_command/2 considers that commands
%% with result type different than rescode or restuple
%% are commands that can be safely executed automatically
%% to get information and build the web page.

-type oauth_scope() :: atom().

%% ejabberd_commands OAuth ReST ACL definition:
%% Two fields exist that are used to control access on a command from ReST API:
%% 1. Policy
%% If policy is:
%%  - restricted: command is not exposed as OAuth Rest API.
%%  - admin: Command is allowed for user that have Admin Rest command enabled by access rule: commands_admin_access
%%  - user: Command might be called by any server user.
%%  - open: Command can be called by anyone.
%%
%% Policy is just used to control who can call the command. A specific additional access rules can be performed, as
%% defined by access option.
%% Access option can be a list of:
%% - {Module, accessName, DefaultValue}: Reference and existing module access to limit who can use the command.
%% - AccessRule name: direct name of the access rule to check in config file.
%% TODO: Access option could be atom command (not a list). In the case, User performing the command, will be added as first parameter
%% to command, so that the command can perform additional check.
