                              Release Notes
                             ejabberd 3.0.0

  ejabberd 3.0.0 is the first release in the brand new 3.x.x branch,
  and includes several minor bugfixes and a few improvements.

ejabberd 3.0.0 includes three major changes:

* exmpp is now extensively used in ejabberd for parsing stanzas, and many more.

* gen_storage (abbreviated GS) provides a database abstraction layer,
  which supports storage in Mnesia and in ODBC databases.
  Several ejabberd modules use GS, like mod_roster and ejabberd_auth_storage.
  The schema of the tables stored by those modules have changed.
  ejabberd automatically creates mnesia and ODBC tables,
  and migrates them from a previous ejabberd version.

* Massive Hosting (abbreviated MH) is preliminary implemented in ejabberd,
  but it is still incomplete, untested and undocumented.
